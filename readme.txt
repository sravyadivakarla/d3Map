Milestone :

So in the project I have created a a map for the cencus. Right now it works for v3. I need to concert it. I also want to add more inteactivity.
I thought that I can add some more interactivity in the side bar. Also make the items realate to eachother. I want to make a zoom in and out feature too.

I think for me I need to tie the information in and maybe relate it to another dataset to make the visual information more valuable to the users

You must use firefox to view the project and must use the pop.html to open the file.
